#Tidy version of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
## Version 1.0

Tidy dataset created as a project for the MOOC "Getting and cleaning data" by Johns Hopkins University, held on Coursera

The original dataset comes from:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

## The dataset includes the following files:

* 'README.md'

* 'run_analysis.R': R script that generates both the datasets and the codebooks

* 'mainDataset.txt': text file containing the main dataset

* 'mainCodebook.md': codebook for 'mainDataset.txt'

* 'secondaryDataset.txt': text file containing the secondary dataset

* 'secondaryCodebook.md': codebook for 'mainDataset.txt'

## How it works

Put the script 'run_analysis.R' in the root folder of the dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) and run it. 
The script loads the files and generates two tidy datasets and two codebooks.
